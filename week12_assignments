* [Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
    - Finish all Readings, Videos, and Quizzes for the following sections in [Week 3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/3):
        - [Logisitic Regression](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/3)
        - [Regularization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/3)
* [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)
    - Finish all Videos, Readings, Key Terminology, Playground Exercises, __Programming Assignments__, and Check Your Understanding for the following sections. 
        - [First Steps with TF](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/first-steps-with-tensorflow/video-lecture): There's are 4 _Programming Assignments_ with this section which will run on [Google's Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) platform. These are very similar to Jupyter notebooks, but will *not* run locally.  
            - Quick Introduction to NumPy (optional)
